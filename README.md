## **Problem Description**
Managing patient collections and appointment scheduling is a persistent challenge for small healthcare businesses, such as independent MRI centers. These businesses often rely on outdated systems or manual processes, which can lead to inefficiencies, missed payments, and scheduling conflicts. A well-designed software system could address these pain points by automating workflows, improving data accuracy, and enhancing patient experience.

## **Domain of Practice**
The domain for this problem is healthcare administration, specifically tailored to small-scale diagnostic imaging centers like MRI facilities. The focus is on optimizing administrative tasks such as patient billing, appointment scheduling, and payment tracking.

## **My Interest**
I have a personal interest in this domain because I come from a family of small business owners. My dad has managed an MRI center since 2019, and I witnessed firsthand the challenges he faced in managing their patient collection. As someone with a passion for technology, I believe that building software solutions can empower small business owners to streamline their operations and focus on growth.

## **Proposed System**
I envision a system called "MRI Care Manager," which would serve as a comprehensive solution for small diagnostic imaging centers. The system would include the following features:

- **Appointment Scheduling:** A user-friendly interface for patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments online.
- **Billing and Payment Tracking:** Automated billing processes with integration for online payment gateways.
- **Patient Management:** A centralized database for storing and accessing patient records, including prior imaging history.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Tools to generate insights on patient flow, revenue, and operational efficiency.

By prototyping "MRI Care Manager," I aim to gain a deeper understanding of healthcare administration challenges and explore how software design can address these issues effectively.
