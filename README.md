## **Introduction**
Small businesses often struggle with managing their inventory efficiently. Many small business owners rely on outdated methods such as spreadsheets or even manual tracking, which can lead to errors, lost sales, and overstocking or understocking products. This inefficiency affects their ability to compete with larger businesses that use sophisticated inventory management systems. To address this, I want to explore the development of an inventory management system tailored to the needs of small business owners.  

## **The Problem**
Small businesses frequently lack the resources to invest in expensive enterprise-level inventory management systems. For example, a local bookstore may struggle to track its sales and inventory effectively. Without accurate data, the owner might overstock certain books, tying up cash flow, or understock popular items, leading to lost revenue. The challenge lies in creating a system that is affordable, easy to use, and customizable for different types of small businesses.  

## **The Problem Domain**
The problem is situated in the domain of **small business management**. This domain encompasses the tools and processes used by small business owners to run their operations effectively, such as inventory, sales tracking, and financial reporting. Small businesses operate in a competitive environment where margins are often thin, and owners need tools that save time and reduce errors without requiring advanced technical skills.  

## **My Interest**
I have a personal interest in this domain because I come from a family of small business owners. My parents owned a caf√© for over a decade, and I witnessed firsthand the challenges they faced in managing their inventory. As someone with a passion for technology, I believe that building software solutions can empower small business owners to streamline their operations and focus on growth.  

## **The Proposed System**
I want to design and prototype a **cloud-based inventory management system** specifically for small businesses. The system would allow users to:  
- Track inventory in real-time, including stock levels, reorder points, and low-stock alerts.  
- Visualize sales trends through dashboards and reports.  
- Automatically generate purchase orders when stock falls below a specified threshold.  
- Integrate with point-of-sale (POS) systems to sync sales and inventory data.  

The prototype would focus on usability, offering a simple, intuitive interface with features that are easy for non-technical users to navigate. By creating this system, I aim to understand the design considerations needed to address the unique needs of small business owners.
